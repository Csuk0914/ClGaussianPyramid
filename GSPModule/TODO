* Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning
* Provide all pyramids through the module
* Find how to manage types mangling (for struct like IplImage)
* This is a good place to think about OpenCL connectors in the GSP
 * Work on this began, the main obstacle is that modules must share (from init)
   the opencl context or a command queue depending on what they do
 * For now, the ugly workaround is : "the first module that uses opencl create
   the context/command queue, set a global variable that the following modules
   retrieve".
* This is also a good place to think about C module macros
* When a file hierarchy is decided for the GSP, add a install target
